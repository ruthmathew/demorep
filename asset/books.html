                            The War of the Worlds, is a science fiction novel by H.G. Wells,
                            first published serially by Pearson’s Magazine in the U.K. 
                            and by The Cosmopolitan magazine in the U.S. in 1897. The 
                            novel details a catastrophic conflict between humans and 
                            extraterrestrial “Martians.” It is considered a landmark 
                            work of science fiction, and it has inspired numerous 
                            adaptations and imitations.

                            The Thirty-Nine Steps was written by John Buchan and 
                            published in the year 1915. The book was subsequently made
                            into a film, with several different adaptations. The novel
                            begins as Richard Hannay has just arrived back in London
                            after an extensive stay in South Africa. Hannay is accustomed
                            to a fast-paced lifestyle and quickly tires of the London 
                            scene. Shortly after his return home, he meets a secret 
                            agent who believes that Great Britain is on the verge of a 
                            war with Germany and warns Hannay to be on the lookout for a 
                            group of assassins, collectively known as The Black Stone.

                        <p id="p">
                            William Golding’s first novel Lord of the Flies is one of 
                            the most-read works of contemporary fiction since the Second 
                            World War. The author’s most popular fiction was written in 
                            1954 and has been interpreted politically, religiously, 
                            anthropologically and psychologically although the story 
                            as such is quite simple. However, what makes the book 
                            remarkable is how excessively Golding uses the setting in 
                            order to get across the fable’s moral.

                            The Count of Monte Cristo (French: Le Comte de Monte-Cristo) 
                            is an adventure novel by French author Alexandre Dumas (père) 
                            completed in 1844. The story takes place in France, Italy, 
                            and islands in the Mediterranean during the historical 
                            events of 1815–1839: the era of the Bourbon Restoration 
                            through the reign of Louis-Philippe of France. It begins 
                            just before the Hundred Days period (when Napoleon returned 
                            to power after his exile). The historical setting is a 
                            fundamental element of the book, an adventure story 
                            primarily concerned with themes of hope, justice, vengeance,
                            mercy, and forgiveness. It centres on a man who is wrongfully 
                            imprisoned, escapes from jail, acquires a fortune, and sets 
                            about exacting revenge on those responsible for his imprisonment. His plans have devastating consequences for both the innocent and the guilty.
