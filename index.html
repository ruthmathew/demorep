                                            Hello there! My name is Ruth Matewos.
                                             Iâ€™m a student of Addis Ababa Universty.
                                        </p>
                                        <h4> My childhood</h4>
                                        <p id="p">
                                            Starting fom the scratch I was born in the capital of 
                                            Ethiopia(specifically in Tikur Anbessa Hospital) in
                                            May 22 2000(in Gregorian calander). Then my family 
                                            moved to Hawassa for living. Although I cannot remember
                                            my childhod Hawwasa is my beloved city from my faded 
                                            meomeries. After 6 years we moved back to Addis Ababa.
                                            Then we started living in our current residence
                                            (Asko in Gulele subcity).
                                        </p>

                                <h4 id="clear"> Education</h4>
                                <p> I learned pre-school in Ascko Progress Acadamy.
                                    I finished primary school in Asko Progress Acadamy
                                    ( from grade 1 up to grade 6) and Lideta Catholic 
                                    Cathedral School( from grade 7 up to grade 8). 
                                    I finished secondary school in Lideta Catholic Catedral
                                    School. Most of my memories about my life are connected
                                    with my school life (specially in LCCS). 
                                    As every child in generation I always had diffrent answers
                                    when people asked me what I want to be when I grow up. 
                                    I didnot get the question untill I was grade 5 student.
                                    My answer was to be a Pilot in grade 7. In grade 9
                                    I wanted to be a desiner. In grade 12 I wanterd to join
                                    the medical school or be an arctect but none of this
                                    assumptions became true.
                                </p>
        
                                <h4> Youth</h4>
                                <p> Now I am an engeneering student at ITSC center 
                                    of Addis Ababa Institute of Technology. My freshman year
                                    had a lot of ups and downs. The first semister was 
                                    exciting and easy as I was learning common course of pre 
                                    Engineering. Then on second semister I joined Software 
                                    Engineering Department.
                                    Then my life started getting boring becouse it was always
                                    about attending endless classes, doing assignments, studing for 
                                    tests and getting surprized by the results.
                                    My Second year's first semister was the best time of all
                                    becouse it was the time were I knew  I can be A software engineer,
                                    how to handle my works and workout on my schedules 
                                    and got to know my field more. <br>
                                    My hobbies are hiking, listning(anything), swimming,
                                    travelig etc... I prefer reading books over sport and
                                    watching movies over paying games. They are part of
                                    hobbies. And mostly I enjoy thinking about somthing 
                                    in a quite and dark place.
