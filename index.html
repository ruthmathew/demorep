                                    Hello there! My name is Ruth Matewos.
                                     I’m a student of Addis Ababa Universty.
                                </p>
                                <h4> My childhood</h4>
                                <p id="p">
                                    Starting fom the scratch I was born in the capital of 
                                    Ethiopia(specifically in Tikur Anbessa Hospital) in
                                    May 22 2000(in Gregorian calander). Then my family 
                                    moved to Hawassa for living. Although I cannot remember
                                    my childhod Hawwasa is my beloved city from my faded 
                                    meomeries. After 6 years we moved back to Addis Ababa.
                                    Then we started living in our current residence
                                    (Asko in Gulele subcity).
                                </p>

                        <h4 id="clear"> Education</h4>
                        <p> I learned pre-school in Ascko Progress Acadamy.
                            I finished primary school in Asko Progress Acadamy
                            ( from grade 1 up to grade 6) and Lideta Catholic 
                            Cathedral School( from grade 7 up to grade 8). 
                            I finished secondary school in Lideta Catholic Catedral
                            School. Most of my memories about my life are connected
                            with my school life (specially in LCCS). 
                            As every child in generation I always had diffrent answers
                            when people asked me what I want to be when I grow up. 
                            I didnot get the question untill I was grade 5 student.
                            My answer was to be a Pilot in grade 7. In grade 9
                            I wanted to be a desiner. In grade 12 I wanterd to join
                            the medical school or be an arctect but none of this
                            assumptions became true.

                        <h4> Youth</h4>
                        <p> Now I am an engeneering student at ITSC center 
                            of Addis Ababa Institute of Technology. My freshman year
                            had a lot of ups and downs. The first semister was 
                            exciting and easy as I was learning common course of pre 
                            Engineering. Then on second semister I joined Software 
                            Engineering Department.
                            Then my life started getting boring becouse it was always
                            about attending endless classes, doing assignments, studing for 
                            tests and getting surprized by the results.
                            My Second year's first semister was the best time of all
                            becouse it was the time were I knew  I can be A software engineer,
                            how to handle my works and workout on my schedules 
                            and got to know my field more. <br>
                            My hobbies are hiking, listning(anything), swimming,
                            travelig etc... I prefer reading books over sport and
                            watching movies over paying games. They are part of
                            hobbies. And mostly I enjoy thinking about somthing 
                            in a quite and dark place.
